Hello, I'm Christofer Werner.

__Profession__: Industrial Engineer

__Likes__: Resolve problems and abstract thinking. I enjoy learning about new things, specially if it's about mathematics and machine learning. 

__Dislikes__: Monotony, repetitive actions and lack of a challenge. Also, messy code. Even though I can't keep mine perfectly clean.

Here I have some repositories about machone learning. 
Right now I'm mainy doing the exercises from the book "Reinfocement Learning: An Introduction" from Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto.

"Time give you new tools to improve. It's up to you to use them..."
